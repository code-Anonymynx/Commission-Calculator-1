**This is my VERY FIRST coding project.**

I started learning the basics of Python and decided to give my knoweledge a little test - so I build a Commission Calculator, based on my current wages in a sales role. The commission structure is fairly complex so for the sake of building something (and saving me time later) I gave it a go. 

**Here are the "rules" of my commision**: 

- Daily Pay = £92
- Lead Generation = £2.50 per lead, up to a max of 4
- Sales = £20 for the first 2, then £10 for every sale after (uncapped)
- Weekly Shift Completion = £50 for x5 days, £100 for x6
- Monthly Shift Completion = £150 for minimum x14 days 

**Background**: 

The project was written first in Python using a random tab from a freecodingcamp lesson. After a while I installed Visual Code Studio and was _finally_ 
able to save the file and publish it here! Yay!

About a week later, I learned about Jupyter Notebook and gave it another go; this time in chunks. 
In the same day while I was still thinking about it, I build another quick version in "Julia". I didn't really edit much in terms of the functions of the code - the point was mainly to test my knoweledge of coniditionals in a new language. 

**Usage**:

It doesn't have any pretty UI yet - it runs very simply. But it does "talk to you nicely". 
It relies on manual editing to compile the daily & weekly results. A lazy solution, but doesn't really matter as it does also help me keep track of it as I go - as long as I remember to save the file each time! 

**Notes**:

I may play around with this later to make it more automated, and/or to give it a nicer UI. 
This _might_ be more fun in Julia just because of the easy access to emojis. (I _really_ like this function.)
