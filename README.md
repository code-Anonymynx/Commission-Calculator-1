**This is my VERY FIRST coding project.**

I started learning the basics of Python and decided to give my knoweledge a little test - so I build a Commission Calculator, based on my current wages in a sales role. The commission structure is fairly complex so for the sake of building something (and saving me time later) I gave it a go. 

**Here are the "rules" of my commision**: 

- Daily Pay = £92
- Lead Generation = £2.50 per lead, up to a max of 4
- Sales = £20 for the first 2, then £10 for every sale after (uncapped)
- Weekly Shift Completion = £50 for x5 days, £100 for x6
- Monthly Shift Completion = £150 for minimum x14 days 

**Background**: 

The project was written first in Python using a random tab from a freecodingcamp lesson. After a while I installed Visual Code Studio and was _finally_ 
able to save the file and publish it here! Yay!

About a week later, I learned about Jupyter Notebook and gave it another go; this time in chunks. 
In the same day while I was still thinking about it, I build another quick version in "Julia". I didn't really edit much in terms of the functions of the code - the point was mainly to test my knoweledge of coniditionals in a new language. 

**Usage**:

It doesn't have any pretty UI yet - it runs very simply. But it does "talk to you nicely". 
It relies on manual editing to compile the daily & weekly results. A lazy solution, but doesn't really matter as it does also help me keep track of it as I go - as long as I remember to save the file each time! 

**Notes**:

I may play around with this later to make it more automated, and/or to give it a nicer UI. 
This _might_ be more fun in Julia just because of the easy access to emojis. (I _really_ like this function.)



**UPDATE**:

I have decided to rebuild this chunk of code, as it's been a few weeks of learning since my last write. This time the code require input, and will store user data to make the code easier to work with. It currently creates 2x equal length lists which stores the number of sales made and lead generations made each day.

**NEXT STEPS**:

Will be to calculate the sales & lead generation bonus' based on the user data inputted.

**LATER EDITS**:

  - I will also add the new parameters of commission we have for work now
  - I will add a minimum 1 sale requirement parameter for the monthly shift complete bonus
  - I will account for tax



**UPDATE the SECOND**:

 - I have moved back over to Python. Despite really enjoying Julia, it seems less used.
 - Work now NO LONGER offer Lead Generation bonus' - sad - so I removed this feature.
 - It turns out we also get a £50 bonus for >10 sales a week. So I added this in.
 - It's now much more functional in that you can calculate a whole month, not just one week.
 - It also adds the weekly shift complete bonus'.
 - I added a bit to account for tax.

**NEXT STEPS**:

- I will add a minimum 1 sale requirement parameter for the monthly shift complete bonus

**LATER EDITS**:

  - MAKE IT PRETTY!
